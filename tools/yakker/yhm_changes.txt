- Added option to yakker to escape grammar.
- Decided to filter termgrammar and binder rules by  whether the
symbols starts with a upper case letter.
- Added minus_elim on grammar before printing it (when no other params
specified).
- Added option to turn of minus elimination. Most useful because it
also turns off charset optimization. Ultimately, I think we should
separate these features.

- Added support for returning the value of semantic actions in nested
  rules. Use "rule $$ id" instead of "rule $ id".

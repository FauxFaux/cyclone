Using cycbison:

* Here's a sample grammar for reverse-polish notation.  Note that we
more or less follow exactly the same conventions as in the C version.
You translate it to cyclone code with:

  cycbison -d rpcalc.y

This produces two files rpcalc_tab.cyc and rpcalc_tab.h.  The .h file
is suitable for including within a lexer or some other tool.  The parser
contains all of the tables as well as the parse engine.  It's invoked
by calling yyparse() which in turn calls yylex() expecting that yylex()
produces an integer token and a semantic value in yylval.

The type of yylval is specified with the %union declaration.  This is
required for us (but optional for C-bison.)  The syntax for the
declaration does not mention the type -- it becomes YYSTYPE.

One declares tokens using the %token <id> notation as in bison.

One declares the type of tokens (terminals) and non-terminals
using %type <field> t1 t2 ... tn where <field> is a field of
the %union type, and t1,t2,...,tn are [non-]terminals.  

The grammar rules work just as in bison/yacc.  The biggest difference
is within the actions of the grammar rules.  In particular, $$ refers
to yylval.  Because it's declared to be of type YYSTYPE, anything
that goes into $$ should have this type.  If you use it as an r-value,
then you probably need to switch on it.

$1 $2 and so forth continue to refer to the semantic elements of the rule.
They are translated so as to implicitly "downcast" to the "type" of
the [non-]terminal.

Some new syntax is ^$(e).  This is essentially translated to new
field(e) where field is the field name of the union associated with $$
(i.e., the rule's left-hand-side.)

So for instance, in the grammar below, for the "+" case, we have as the
action:

	exp : exp exp '+' { $$ = ^$($1 + $2); }

The $1 gets the exp value.  Since exp is associated with the foo label
of the union, this means that the semantic value is cast to "int" from
YYSTYPE.  Similarly for $2.  The default semantic value would be there
for the token '+'.  Anyway, because $1 and $2 are automatically cast
to integers, we can add them to produce an integer.  But we can't
just place the result in $$ -- rather, we have to "cast up", hence
the ^$ wrapped around the expression.

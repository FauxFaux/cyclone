You can use a stock GNU Flex to generate Cyclone scanners (that is,
scanners that can be compiled by the Cyclone compiler).  Simply use
the -S option to GNU Flex to specify this skeleton file.

This is useful when porting C code that uses a Flex scanner; it means
that we don't have to port all of Flex to Cyclone.  Naturally the Flex
option to generate a C++ scanner class is unsupported.

Cyclex was ported from ocamllex, part of the OCaml 3.01 distribution (see
http://caml.inria.fr).  The changes to the OCaml source are provided as a
patch, ocamllex2cyclex.patch, to the original OCaml 3.01 sources, as
required by the Q public license which governs the distribution of OCaml
source code.  This license is included in the file LICENSE.

To create the contents of this directory from the OCaml sources, do the
following (assuming the ocaml-3.01 source is installed in directory CAMLDIR,
and that cyclone is installed in directory CYCDIR):

cp -r CAMLDIR/lex /tmp/lex
cp ocamllex2cyclex.patch /tmp
cd /tmp/lex
patch -p1 < ../ocamllex2cyclex.patch
mkdir genfiles
mv lexer.cyc genfiles
cd ..
mv lex CYCDIR/tools/cyclex
rm -f ocamllex2cyclex.patch

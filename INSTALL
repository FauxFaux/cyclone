OVERVIEW

To build Cyclone, do

./configure
make
make install

To get off the ground, you need GNU make and bash; bash is assumed to
be in the /bin directory.  If GNU make is not the default make on 
your system, if might be installed as "gmake" so just type gmake 
instead of make if things don't work.  If you have bash installed 
somewhere other than /bin, then edit the configure script and the 
config/cyc_install scripts so that their first lines point to the 
location of bash.  For example, if bash were stored in 
/usr/local/bin/bash, you would change

#!/bin/bash

to 

#!/usr/local/bin/bash

in those two files.  If you do not have bash installed on your system,
you can use ksh (i.e., change #!/bin/bash to #!/bin/ksh).  Ultimately,
we will automate this mess so that you don't have to worry about it.

By default, binaries will be stored into /usr/local/bin, libraries into
/usr/local/lib/cyclone, and include files into /usr/include/cyclone.  If
your architecture is not supported, you will have the opportunity to port it
(see below).  If you wish to install into different directories, specify
them using the options -bindir and -libdir and -incdir.  For example, you
could do

./configure -bindir /usr/bin -libdir /usr/lib/cyclone

to alter the binary directory to /usr/bin and the library directory to
/usr/lib/cyclone (while leaving the include directory as
/usr/include/cyclone).

If you wish to remove cyclone after installing it, simply do

make uninstall

and it will remove any files and directories created in your system
directories as a result of installation.

Note that configure and make install use several utilities, which
need to be in your path.  In our experience, this is the most common
source of problems.  In particular:
(1) you need Gnu-like behavior for egrep.  Set an EGREP environment variable
to point to an appropriate egrep if necessary.
(2) Windows systems tend to have a program called find that is
different than the find we are expecting.  cygwin puts the find we
want in /usr/bin -- make sure a different find is not earlier in your
path.

PORTING TO UNSUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES

If your architecture is not currently supported, the configure script will
ask if you'd like to create the files necessary to support it.  For a new
architecture ARCH, this will result in creating the files config/arch/ARCH,
config/arch/ARCH.undef, a directory bin/genfiles/ARCH containing additional
subdirectories, and the file ARCH.h stored in lib/arch and include/arch.

Now type make (from the cyclone directory) to compile the C files in
bin/genfiles/ARCH.  Since you are trying to port your architecture, these
files came from an existing architecture, so they may not work.  If not, you
can either try to modify them by hand, or cross-compile from a supported
architecture, as explained below.

If they did work, you can now recompile the compiler and update your
architecture-specific files.  In particular

a) Build Cyclone for the source files by doing

make cyclone_src

This will build the .c files in the lib and src directories.

d) Install the .c files for the new architecture by doing

make update

This will copy all of the relevant files for the new architecture to
bin/genfiles/ARCH.

e) Recompile the compiler by doing

make

At the completion of make, you should be able to install the compiler
specialized for your architecture.

CROSS-COMPILING FROM A SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURE

If compiling for the default .c files did not work, you can cross-compile
from a supported architecture as follows:

a) Assuming you have done ./configure on the architecture you wish to
support (thus creating the appropriate config/arch/ and bin/genfiles/ files
as described above), copy the entire cyclone source tree to a supported
architecture.

b) Configure the the source tree on the supported architecture by doing
./configure again.  This should set up your configuration properly and
indicate you are on a supported architecture.

c) Build Cyclone for the unsupported architecture by doing

make cyclone_src TARGET=ARCH

(where ARCH is the unsupported architecture).  This will build the .c files
in a newly created ARCH directory, using the information in the
architecture-specific file for ARCH.

d) Install the .c files for the new architecture by doing

make update TARGET=ARCH

This will copy all of the relevant files for the new architecture to
bin/genfiles/ARCH.

f) copy the entire source tree back to the new architecture.  Reconfigure it
by doing ./configure, and then try building it again by doing make.  If
cross-compilation worked, it should now build correctly. (Please send us the
ARCH directory in bin/genfiles, and the ARCH and ARCH.undef file in
config/arch so we can then incorporate these into our normal distribution
tree.)

---

If things fail to build either with the default .c files or with the
cross-compiler, it is probably due to library incompatibilities.  These will
require changes to the Makefile and/or the Cyclone source, so please send us
e-mail and we can help work these out.

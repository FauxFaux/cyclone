OVERVIEW

To build Cyclone, you follow the standard procedure:

./configure
make

Eventually, we'll include a "make install" part of this that will
stick it in your system directories.

We also support cross compilation, as described below.  This is need
to port to new architectures (or at least makes it simpler).

DETAILS

1) ./configure

This is a script that sets up the platform-dependent parts of the
installation.  It alters the Makefile.inc file to include two
variables, your architecture is stored in ARCH, and the directory
that the cyclone source tree is stored in is called CYCDIR.

If your architecture is not currently supported, the configure script
will ask if you'd like to create the files necessary to support it.
This will result in creating a file in config/arch for your 
architecture, and will create a directory in bin/genfiles/.  The C
files in this directory will be populated from an existing architecture,
so they will have to be changed if they don't readily compile.  This
can be done by cross-compiling on a supported architecture by using the 
file created by configure in the config/arch directory (see below).

2) make

This compiles from the C files in genfiles/$(ARCH) where $(ARCH) is
your architecture (as determined by config).  If you are trying to
port your architecture, these files came from an existing
architecture, so they may not work.  If not, you can cross-compile
by setting the TARGET makefile variable.  Here's the process:

a) On the architecture you want to support (but isn't currently
supported), type ./configure.  This will create the appropriate
config/arch/ARCH file (where ARCH is the name of your architecture,
as determined by configure), and create the directory bin/genfiles/ARCH.

b) Copy the entire cyclone tree to a supported architecture, after you've
created the new file and directory.  Alternatively, just copy the new
file and directory there in an existing source tree.

c) Configure the the source tree on the supported architecture (this
is not necessary if you just copied the new file and directory, instead
of the entire tree), by doing ./configure again.  This will set up
your Makefile.inc file properly.

d) Build Cyclone for the unsupported architecture by doing

make cyclone_src TARGET=ARCH

(where ARCH is the unsupported architecture; this is also the name
of the new file created in config/arch).  This will build the .c
files in src/ and lib/ for the new architecture, using the information
in the architecture-specific file for ARCH.  All we care about are the
generated C files, so if the executables fail to link, don't worry.

e) Install the .c files for the new architecture by doing

make update TARGET=ARCH

This will copy all of the relevant files for the new architecture.

f) copy the source back to the new architecture.  Reconfigure it
by doing ./configure, and then try building it again by doing make.
If cross-compilation worked, it should now build correctly.  Then
please send us the ARCH directory in bin/genfiles, and the ARCH
file in config/arch.  We can then incorporate these into our
normal distribution tree.

This file explains some of the changes that occurred in between 
releases.

Changes going from Version 0.3 dated 18 April 2002, to Version 0.4:

* Bezillions of bug fixes.  Hopefully, we got yours, but if not,
  please send us a bug report.

* tests/shootout contains a copy of Doug Bagley's shootout code,
  including (a) the original C version, (b) a straightforward
  Cyclone port with minimal changes needed to get it to compile, 
  and (c) an expert Cyclone port that takes advantage of advanced
  Cyclone features.  See the README file.

* Introduced "@tagged union" declarations.  These look and act
  like C unions but include a hidden tag which is updated when
  writing a member, and checked when reading a member.  If you
  attempt to read a member other than the last one written, a
  Match_Exception is thrown.  You can use tagcheck(e.m) as a
  boolean expression to check whether or not m was the last 
  member written in a tagged union (also tagcheck(e->m) for
  pointers to tagged unions.)  
  
* Our old "tunion" and "xtunion" types have been renamed to
  "datatype" and "@extensible datatype" respectively to avoid
  confusion with @tagged unions.

* e.size has changed to numelts(e).  

* Because users found our pointer notation cryptic, we have 
  introduced "long forms" for the various kinds of pointer
  qualifiers:

  @notnull/@nullable:  whether or not the pointer can be NULL
  @zeroterm/@nozeroterm:  whether or not the sequence is zero-terminated
  @thin/@fat: whether or not the pointer is fat
  @numelts(e): upper bound on number of elements in sequence
  @region(`r): region into which pointer refers

  You can still use the old abbreviations if you prefer.  So,
  for instance:

  int *@notnull@numelts(42)@region(`r) == int @{42}`r

* Introduced what we call "dynamic" regions.  Dynamic regions can
  be deallocated at any time (as long as they're not open.)  However,
  to access data in a dynamic region, or to allocate data in the
  region, you have to open it up.  The open will fail if the region
  has already been freed.  Dynamic regions are particularly useful
  in conjunction with existential types, and are good for those
  situations where you cannot statically determine the lifetimes
  of objects.  

* We now support writing down arbitrary union types.  However, if
  they are untagged, then you can only read out the "bits-only"
  members.  

* You can use ",..." in tuple, struct, and datatype patterns to
  match against any number of fields that you want to ignore.
  For instance:

  struct Foo {int a,b,c,d,e,f,g;};

  int foo(struct Foo f) {
    let Foo{.a = a, .g = g, ...} = f;
    return a + g;
  }

* You can omit the struct or tagged union's name in a pattern,
  as long as we can determine it from context.  So, the foo function
  above can be rewritten as simply:

  int foo(struct Foo f) {
    let {.a = a, .g = g, ...} = f;
    return a + g;
  }

* You can write "<id> as <pat>" as a pattern like ML.  This binds
  the value being matched to the identifier, but continues matching
  it to extract more values in <pat>.  

* You no longer have to write kinds on bound type variables of
  type definitions -- they are inferred from the definition.  
  You *do* have to write kinds on type declarations or else the
  kinds default to ::B (boxed).  So, for instance, if you write:

    struct List<`a,`r>;

  then this elaborates to: 
  
    struct List<`a::B,`r::B>;

  To make `r have region kind (::R) you need to put it in explicitly:

    struct List<`a,`r::R>;

  However, if you give a definition for List, then you do not
  need to declare the kind of `r as it can be inferred:

    struct List<`a,`r> { `a hd; struct List<`a,`r>*`r tl; }

* The syntax for declaring regions has changed slightly.  It used to be:

    region r <stmt> 

  Now it's more like a C declaration:

    region r; <stmt>

* There is now some support for dependent array sizes.  For a
  good example, see tests/shootout/cyc-matrix.cyc which is a
  version of matrix multiplication that takes in a matrix with
  statically unknown dimensions.  The interface for the function
  looks like this:

  void mmult(tag_t rows,
             tag_t cols,
             int @{cols}@{rows} m1,
             int @{cols}@{cols} m2,
             int @{cols}@{rows} m3);

  Note that the number of rows and columns of m1, m2, and m3
  depend upon the tag_t values rows and cols.  Tag values are
  unsigned, singleton integers.  The above is really shorthand
  for:

  void mmult(tag_t<`i::I> rows,
             tag_t<`j::I> cols,
             int @{valueof(`j)}@{valueof(`i)} m1,
             int @{valueof(`j)}@{valueof(`j)} m2,
             int @{valueof(`j)}@{valueof(`i)} m3);

  Here we see that rows is some unsigned integer named `i at
  the type-level, cols is some unsigned integer named `j,
  and the number of rows and columns of m1,m2, and m3 depends
  upon the value of `i and `j.  

  The valueof(T) form takes a type-level (integer-kinded) expression
  and allows you to embed the type into a value-level expression
  which can be used to specify a bound on an array as in the example
  above.  Furthermore, in the matrix multiply example code, the flow 
  analysis is smart enough to avoid all run-time checks.  As a result,
  the output of Cyclone is equivalent to the original C code.

  Sadly, we have not yet updated the documentation to cover this
  feature in detail.

* You don't have to write a type-level region name in a prototype --
  you can use the variable instead.  That is, you can abbreviate:

    void foo(region_t<`r> r, int*`r)

  with

    void foo(region_t r, int*`r)

* Patterns can now include (almost) arbitrary constant expressions.

* There's a primitive porting tool.  If you take a C file (say foo.c)
  copy it to foo.cyc and wrap the code that you want ported with:
  __cyclone_port_on__; ... __cyclone_port_off__; and compile the
  file with "cyclone -port", then the compiler will spit out a list
  of edits.  These edits may be applied with the bin/rewrite tool
  to produce foo_new.cyc.  The tool attempts to figure out where 
  fat pointers are needed, what the region interface for a function
  should be, and where to insert const so that things will type-check
  under Cyclone's rules.  This won't succeed most of the time, but
  it will generally get your code closer.  

* Added extern "C include" declarations.  These allow you to define
  C code inline in a Cyclone file.  For example:

  extern "C include" { 
    int peek(int i) {
       return *((int *)i);
    }
  } export {
    peek;
  }

  The code is (mostly) ignored by Cyclone and spit out for C to
  compile.  The interface is processed by Cyclone, so you can use
  Cyclone types in it (e.g., ?) but you can't use Cyclone features
  within the definitions.  The export section identifies those 
  identifiers you want to export to the Cyclone environment.  
  A typical use is something like:

  extern "C include" {
  #include <c_code.h>
  // wrappers to make c_code safe
  } export {
    // functions in c_code already safe and wrappers,
    // but not unsafe functions.
  }

* There's some support for "unique pointers".  If you have a unique
  pointer to an object, then you can free it at will.  However, 
  you cannot make copies of unique pointers.  You can swap unique
  pointer values within shared data structures.  And there is some
  tentative support for writing code that is polymorphic over whether
  or not a pointer is unique, but this has not yet been worked out
  to our satisfaction. 

* The compiler has been modified to use either (a) fine-grained
  regions for all memory management, (b) coarse-grained regions,
  or (c) the garbage collector.  Right now, the default is to use
  coarse-grained regions.  This won't have any effect on users,
  but if you've been staring at the Cyclone source code, you'll
  now see a lot more uses of regions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes going from Version 0.2 dated 20 November 2001, to Version 0.3:

* In order to provide better library coverage, we had to cut back
  on the number of platforms that we support directly.  In particular,
  we now only provide support for linux x86, cygwin, and Mac OS X.
  Other architectures might or might not work.  To port to a new
  architecture requires more work -- see the INSTALL file for details.

* Introduction of the buildlib tool to simplify interface to C
  and to provide a portable way to extract Cyclone header files
  and wrappers for a C library.  This tool is used to build all
  of the system-dependent libraries (e.g., stdio).  See the
  documentation for details.

* Worked around a bug in GCC that prevented us from building on
  Mac OS X.  The problem involves nested statement expressions
  ({S;e}) which we use heavily.  The temporary fix is to use
  inlined functions for certaion operations instead of macro's
  which expand to these.  Unfortunately, the macro's produced
  much better code since GCC doesn't do certain optimizations
  after inlining.  So, as a result, only certain files are 
  compiled with the inlined functions (the ones that were causing
  the problems.)

* Data structures that are "bits-only" (i.e., consisting of ints,
  chars, floats, etc. but not pointers or zero-terminated arrays)
  need not be initialized.

* Much more complete library coverage.  After installing, look
  in lib/cyc-lib/<architecture>/include to see what is and isn't
  there.  Read the buildlib documentation for details on how to
  add new library functions.  

* 0 can be used in place of NULL (except within patterns).

* Added long double support.

* Support for anonymous structions, unions, etc.  

* Added sizeof_t<T> which is the type of sizeof(e) when e has type T.
  Useful for specifying prototypes on things like memmove, memcpy,
  memset, bzero, etc.

* Added support for malloc/calloc for more than one object.  You can
  use malloc for "bits-only" arrays, and calloc to allocate arrays
  of any type that supports 0 as a value, including * and ? types.

* Can cast bits only types to char? types.  

* Added an option --lineno that emits line-number information in the
  generated C code.  Helps when using gdb to debug Cyclone code but
  doesn't work all that well yet and takes a long time to compile
  and generates large files.

* Added a Cyclonized version of flex.

* Flags --nochecks, -nonullchecks, and --noboundschecks can be used
  to turn off bounds checks.  

* We eliminate an array bounds check on a subscript of the form x[i]
  where x and i are local variables that do not escape, and the 
  subscript is dominated by a test of the form i < x.size or
  i < y and y <= x.size.  You can use assert to force checks to move
  outside of loops too.  See the string library for examples.

* Fewer warnings about dereferencing a possibly-NULL pointer when
  you've already checked that it's not NULL.

* You can leave the return type off of a function and it defaults
  to int.  

* We now only warn if you fail to return a "bits-only" type instead
  of generating an error.

* We support the "noreturn" attribute which is useful for giving
  the control-flow analysis more accuracy.  

* We warn when main() has a bad type.

* Removed existential types from tunions and instead added them
  to structs.  

* Added support for abstract typedef's.  You can write:
  typedef _ t;  and t is treated as an abstract type (of Box kind).

* Added support for "resetable" dynamic regions.  (Need to update
  the documentation to show how to use them.)  Here's an example:

    region [resetable] r {
       ... allocate data in r ...
       reset_region(r); // frees all data in r and kills 
                        // all variables that might point into r
       ... allocate new data in r ...
    }

* Added support for initializing something through a procedure
  call.  For instance, given the prototype:

    void f(int @x) __attribute__((initializes(1)));

  you can call f with a pointer to something that is not yet
  initialized and conclude that after the call, it is initialized.

* Added preliminary support for "tag types" which will allow you
  to connect the size of an array to an integer value.  More
  support forthcoming along with documentation.

* Added preliminary support for type representations.  More
  support forthcoming along with documentation.

* Added support for outlives bounds for quantified regions.  See
  the fn library for an example and the PLDI paper for details.

* Added support for zero-terminated arrays and pointers.  For
  instance, char *ZEROTERM is a pointer to a zero-terminated
  sequence of characters (i.e., a C string).  You can do some
  limited subscripting and pointer arithmetic on such pointers,
  but it's expensive.  It's much better to convert the value
  to a char ?ZEROTERM and then manipulate it.  This is likely
  to be the most confusing a difficult change to deal with.
  See the documentation for more examples and the limitations
  of these pointers.  Finally, note that char pointers by
  default are assumed to be ZEROTERM.  If you mean for them
  to not be ZEROTERM, then you need to write NOZEROTERM 
  explicitly (e.g., char ?NOZEROTERM).

* More flexible parsing of GCC-style attributes.

* Improved error reporting as best we could.

* Use GCC-style locations when reporting an error (e.g., file:lineno)
  instead of also including the character offset in the line.  You can
  get the more detailed location information by using the
  -detailedlocation flag.

* Support all casts to void now.

* Use -maarch=i686 when compiling on an x86 to avoid having GCC
  using movsl to copy structs (i.e., ? types).  Much improved
  performance.

* The argv passed to Cyclone's main now includes a NULL temrinator.
  Thus, argc = argv.size + 1.

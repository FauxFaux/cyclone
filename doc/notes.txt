More changes (as of 2/3/00):

0. parser seems to work well -- ported the list library (see list.cyc)
as a good test case and have used it to work out what appear to be most
of the bugs.  We have 3 benign shift-reduce conflicts that would be too
painful to get rid of.  

1. "let pat = exp;" no longer needs { .. } around the following statement list
and is thus as convenient as our old-style "_ x = e".

2. for statements support a declaration as in "for (int i=0; i < 10; i++) ..."

3. cyclone support (codegen, cut, fill, splice) added.

Recent changes:  see todo.txt for things that still need to be done
including updating this psuedo-documentation.

0. tried to label Cyclone additions/changes in grammar with /* Cyc: ... */

1. use `a instead of ?a for type variables to avoid problem with
   conditional expressions.

2. use "int ^x;" instead of "int !x;" to denote a definite pointer.  
   Use "int @x;" instead?

3. collapsed data-types into enum's -- got rid of "data" declarations.
   This is a bit tricky:  non-value-carrying constructors are declared
   as in enums.  For instance, one can write:

     enum bool {false=0,true=1};
     enum day {Sun=0,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat};

   Notice the constructors are comma-separated, have no type, and can
   have a constant expression denoting the value of the tag.  For
   value-carrying constructors, we have syntax that looks more like
   struct/union fields with an optional (constant) initializer 
   expression for declaring the value of the tag.  For instance:

     enum exp {Plus,Times,Minus,Div,   // looks like enum constructors
               int    Int=0;           // Int(i) is represented as ^[S(0),i]
               string Var=1;          
               $(enum exp,enum exp) App;  // tag isn't necessary
               $(string,enum exp) Lam;
              };

   Notice that value-carrying constructors are terminated with a
   semi-colon, that the initializer gives the value of the tag
   used for that constructor, etc.  Type parameters may be used
   as in structs:

     enum option<`a> { None=0, `a Some; };

4. collapsed newtypes into enum's -- each data constructor can have
   a set of existentially-quantified variables which are bound during
   pattern matching (or the let statement).  For example:

     enum fn<`a,`b> { `b _(`a) Prim; }
                      $(`b _(`env,`a), `env) Closure<`env>; }
     
     `b apply<`a,`b>(enum fn<`a,`b> f, `a arg) {
        switch f {
          case Prim(p):  return p(arg);
          case Closure<`c>$(code,e):
             `c env = e;  // just to demonstrate use of existential var `c
             return code(env,arg);
          }
      }

5. renamed "with" statement to "let" statement and generalized it
   so that we bind a pattern.  This is the approved way of binding
   local variables in functions without having to write a type down.
   This is also the way to destructure an enum with one constructor
   (and to bind the existentially-quantified type variables).  For
   example:

     enum closure<`a,`b> { $(`b _(`env,`a), `env) Closure<`env>; }

     `b apply<`a,`b>(enum closure<`a,`b> f, `a arg) {
        let Closure<`c>(code,e) {
          `c env = e;
           return code(env,arg);
        }
      }

     
6. got rid of "new" for structs, enums, and tuples.  For structs/enums, 
   one writes  x(e1,...,en) where x is the name of the struct or
   data constructor and the e1,...,en are the fields within the
   struct/constructor.  Hope to generalize the initializer
   syntax in the future to support x{l1 = e1,...,ln = en} but this
   causes parsing problems right now.  Note that we still use
   new for arrays, array comprehensions, and pointers.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------
These are some notes on Cyclone 2.0 that have grown out of my
messing around with a new parser, reading the ANSI C manual
carefully, and rewriting a few libraries.  

I've started from an ANSI C grammar So where at all possible, the
syntax is now the same as that of C.  So, for example, to cast
something, we write "(type)e" instead of "(:type)e".

Base Types:
-----------
Includes all of the base types of C ([un/signed] char, short, int,
long, float, double) plus bool, exn (exceptions) and a bunch of
"boxed" types (see below).  We use "long long" for 64-bit integers.
"long" is the same as "int".  This is closer to practice for C
compilers on 32-bit machines.

Bool, Char, Int, Short [Int], Long [Int], Long Long [Int], Float, and
Double are the boxed (i.e., 1-word passed in gp-register) variants of
their respective types (bool, char, int, short [int], long [int], long
long [int], float, and double.)  When instantiating a polymorphic
construct, we automatically convert bool->Bool, char->Char, etc.
Thus, if you take the polymorphic identity function and instantiate it
at "float", you get a function from Floats to Floats (not floats to
floats).

Strings are not built in because they may be defined as having
type:  char[?].  

Type Variables:
---------------
We use "?[a-zA-Z0-9_]+" for type variables.  I see no other way to get
things to parse.  In fact, I'm worried about prefix and open which
I've yet to handle.

Pointers:
---------
We use "*" and "!" for pointer types (and as in C, postfix type
application for these.)  The "*" means "pointer option" (null or a
pointer) and the "!" means definitely a pointer.  I'm not sure this is
the right default -- as Trevor points out, it's a bit more consistent
with C, but on the other hand, it encourages C and Java programmers to
use options as the default.  Values of type t! may be implicitly
cast to values of type t*, but not vice versa.  The latter requires
an explicit cast which might fail.  Projections on "*" pointers
might also fail.  

Tuples:
-------
For tuples, we use $(t1,...,tn) as the type -- a tuple pointer is thus
$(t1,...,tn)* or $(t1,...,tn)!.  Similarly within patterns and so
forth.  We use e.i, e->i, and e[i] for projection.  Projections are
zero-based instead of one-based to be consistent with C.  That is,
suppose I have $(int,bool,char) !x; Then (*x).0, x->0, and x[0] (which
are all equivalent) should yield the int.  To create a tuple pointer,
we write "new (e1,...,en)" or "^ (e1,...,en)".

Structs:
--------
Struct types are very close to C, though there are some important
differences in the way scope is treated and in interactions with 
arrays.  First, as in C, structs are named and type equivalence
is by name (not by structure).  Even when you write an anonymous
struct, "struct {int x,y;};" it is given a name internally.  So,
the upshot is that you should name all your structs (except see
interactions with typedef below.)  

  struct Point {int x,y;};  // declares the struct Point
  struct Point *p1,!p2, p3;    // declares p1 and p2 as pointers to structs
                               // p1 may be null, p2 cannot be null.  p3 is
			       // an "unboxed" struct.  

  // structs can contain flattened structs or tuples (no need for pointers)
  struct Square {struct Point upper_left, lower_right; }

Notice that one must write "struct Point" not just "Point" when declaring
a point-struct value.  Typedef can be used to give this a more succinct
name (see below).  

Padding is inserted between fields and at the end of fields to
support "maximal" alignment as in most C implementations.  Thus,
if you write:

  struct Foo {char x; short y; short a; int z; double d;};

you've really written something like:

 //          1 byte  1 byte  2 byte   2 byte   2 byte   4 byte 4 byte 8 byte
 struct Foo {char x; char _; short y; short a; short _; int z; int _; double d}

where the "_" fields represent padding.  

We extract fields as in C.  For instance:

  p1->x + p2->y;
  (*p1).x + (*p2).y;

We create pointers to structs by writing "new struct Point {0,0}" or
"^struct Point {0,0}".  Note that initializer expressions are as in C.
Thus, to create a pointer to a Square, we can write:

  struct Square !s1,!s2;

  s1 = new struct Square {{ulx,uly},{llx,lly},} // extra comma allowed
  s2 = ^struct Square {ulx,uly,llx,lly}   // flattening allowed

Unlike C, struct declarations have global scope for the unit and
may only be declared at the top-level.  We do allow one to write:

  struct Point;

(as in C) as long as there is some definition of Point eventually.
Structs may be declared public, static, extern, or abstract:

  struct Point2 {int x,y;};          // scope is public
  static struct Point3 {int x,y;};   // scope is local to module
  abstract struct Point4 {int x,y;}; // name is exported but definition is not
  extern struct Point5 {int x,y;};   // defined elsewhere as at least public
  extern struct Point6;              // defined elsewhere as at least abstract

When you see only "extern struct Foo;", then you (a) can't initialize a value
that contains a struct Foo, (b) can't project a field out or do anything
with it where the compiler needs to know the size of Foo.  All that you
know is that ! and * apply to struct Foo.  Note that to export other
memory types such as tuples or arrays as "abstract" things that can
have * or ! applied to them, we'll just place them inside a struct.

  // the bitvec module would use this internally
  abstract struct Bitvec {int bits[?];};
  // and export this in its interface
  extern struct Bitvec;

As in C, one can have multiple declarations of a given struct name
within a compilation unit as long as they're all consistent.  One
can even say "extern" on one definition but not another.  The idea
is that we want to support a module #include'ing its own interface
file.  

As in C, unboxed structs are passed by value (copy-in, copy-out).  
Similarly, unboxed tuples are passed by value.  Note that unboxed
tuples or structs that contain arrays of unknown size (or known
but sufficiently large size) are likely to be boxed by the compiler.

Also note that if you (might) apply & to any variable, then that
variable will be boxed by the compiler.  So, for instance, if you
write:

  struct Point p = {0,0};
  struct Point *p_pointer = &p;

Then this will cause p to be heap-allocated.  

Polymorphic structs:
--------------------
Unlike Popcorn, type parameters are on the right (again, a parsing issue.)

  // polymorphic list nodes, parameterized over a boxed element type ?a
  struct ListNode<?a> {?a hd; struct ListNode<?a> *tl;}; 
  // polymorphic tree nodes, parameterized over ?key and ?value types.
  struct TreeNode<?key,?value> {?key key; ?value value; 
                                struct SplayNode<?key,?value> *left,*right};


See the notes on typedef below for how to make this a bit more
succinct.  Note that the type variables can only be instantiated
with boxed types.  Register types such as char, bool, short, float,
and double are automatically promoted to their boxed variants,
Char, Bool, Short, Float, and Double.  Thus, writing "ListNode<char>"
and "ListNode<Char>" are equivalent and such nodes may only 
contain boxed Char values in the head. 

When using new on a polymorphic struct, we need not supply the
type parameters:

   struct ListNode<int> *lis = ^ struct ListNode{1,null};

Data-types:
-----------
Data-types are much like unions in Popcorn and datatypes in SML or
Ocaml.  (I was tempted to generalize "enum" but decided that this
would be hard to do since enum fields can be given integer values, are
treated as integers, don't require new, can have the same integer
value for different constructors, etc.)  As with structs, data-types
must be named (else a name is given to them internally) and 
type equivalence is by name.  Also, one must write "data Day"
not just "Day" within a type expression.  

  // days of the week
  data Day {void Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat;};
  // expressions
  data Exp {string Var; $(data Exp,data Exp) App; $(string,data Exp) Lam;};
  // eithers
  data Either<?a,?b> {?a A; ?b B;};

Notice that the fields can carry memory types -- that is, in Exp
above, both the App and Lam fields carry unboxed tuples, not pointers
to tuples.  Also notice that data-types are boxed types so you don't
need and don't want pointers to them (unlike structs).  As with
structs, data-types can be declared public, static, abstract, extern
(opaque), or extern (transparent).

Unlike Popcorn, one does not have to name the type when creating a
data value.  So, we can simply write `^Sun' to create a day of the
week or we can write `^data Day.Sun'.  We would write `new Var "x"' to
create a variable expression or `new App(e1,e2)'.  One can also write
`new data Exp.Var "x"' or `new data Exp.App(e1,e2)' if you need to
access a field that's been shadowed by another definition.  (Later
data-type definitions shadow the constructors of earlier ones as in
ML.  Unlike ML, there's a way to get back to shadowed definitions.)

Pattern matching within a switch is used to destructure data
expressions.  For example:

  Set::set<string> freevars(data Exp e) {
    switch e {
      case Var x: return Set::single(x);
      case App $(e1,e2): return Set::union(freevars(e1),freevars(e2));
      case Lam $(x,e): return Set::remove(freevars(e),x);
    }
  }

Patterns have been extended to be much more complete, including
characters, integers, wild cards, tuples, structs, "with" clauses
(I used with to save a keyword), null, booleans, and pointers.

As in Popcorn, we also support "datatype projection".  That is,
I can write:

    string varname(data Exp e) {
      return e.Var;
    }
    string argument(data Exp e) {
      return e.App.1;  // remember -- zero based
    }

If the type carried by a field is a register type, then no further
projection is necessary.  If the type is a memory type (i.e., tuple,
struct, or array), then a *copy* of the memory type is extracted.

Arrays:
-------
There are three array constructors: 

  t[]      -- untagged, indeterminate arrays
  t[e]     -- constant-sized arrays (e a constant expression)
  t[?]     -- tagged, indeterminate arrays

All three are memory types.  As in C, arrays variables are passed by
reference (not like other memory values such as unboxed structs and
tuples.)

Internally, t[?] arrays involve a level of indirection and look
something like this using a dependent type notation:

  struct {const unsigned int size; (t[size]) const *elts;}

That is, a value of type t[?] is an unboxed pair of an unsigned int
(giving the size) and a pointer to the underlying array.  The level of
indirection allows us to easily convert a t[e] array to a t[?] array,
by simply allocating a pair with the size (e) followed by the pointer
to the t[e] array.

Arrays of type t[e] may be cast to arrays of type t[] with no cost.
Arrays of type t[?] may be cast to arrays of type t[e] but may require
a run-time bounds check and thus fail.  Arrays of type t[?] may be
cast to type t[] with no check (this is essentially just getting the
elts pointer out of the struct.)  Finally, arrays of type t[e] may be
cast to tuples of type $(t_1,...,t_e) where each t_i = t.

There are no built-in primitive operations on t[] arrays.  Rather, you
must pass the values to (trusted) operations.  For example, C strings
will have the type char[] and may be passed to the C standard library
string manipulation functions.

t[?] arrays and t[e] may be placed in structs or tuples with no
constraints as their size may be determined at compile time.  (The
former is always 2 words).  Within structs, tuples, or arrays, values
of type t[] are similar to abstract structs -- since we cannot
determine the size at compile time, no projections or updates will be
allowed after a t[] element.  Thus, if we have:

  struct Foo {int x; int y[]; bool z;};
  struct Foo *a, b[3];

Then we can read/write a->x, but not a->y or a->z.  We can
also read/write b[0].x, but no other fields or elements of
the array b (because earlier elements in the array or struct
have indeterminate length.)  

We have two ways to express the creation of arrays.  One is
the standard C initializer:

  int x[?] = {0,1,2,3}; 
  $(bool,int) x[4] = {true,1,false,2,true,3,false,4,}; // extra comma okay
                    // and no need for nested parens for tuple values

The other way to create arrays is using an array comprehension:

  int x[?] = {for i < 4 : i};
  int evens[?] = {for i < max_num_evens() : i*2};

Except within initializers, we must use "new" to create array values
(reflecting the fact that these things are passed by reference.)

  x = new {for i < 10 : i*2+3};

At top-level, array comprehensions can only use expressions that
can be evaluated at compile time, for each index value.  

Multi-dimensional arrays are sort of supported but not really.
In particular, the first dimension can have unknown length but
the rest of the dimensions must have a constant length.  So,
for instance, "int x[4][4]"  or "int x[?][4][5];" but not
"int x[?][?]".  

Typedefs: 
--------- 
As in C, typedefs are type abbreviations.  We extend them ever so
slightly to support type constructor abbreviations.  Because they're
just abbreviations, they do not support recursion directly.  (We have
to go through a named type like a struct or data-type to get the type
recursion.)  Also like C, typedef names conflict with *all* other
identifier namespaces.  (The lexer treats them differently than
other identifiers.)  So when picking a typedef name, you want to
pick one that's sufficiently distinct from any variable name that
you might want to use.  

Unlike C, we do not allow typedefs (or struct or data declarations)
anywhere but the top-level.  (We might in the future.)  The scope of a
typedef extends from the point after the definition to the rest of the
file.

Since typedef is an abbreviation, there's no extern, static, or
abstract qualifier (but see below for an interaction with struct and
data declarations.)

Recall that struct and data declarations have global scope (unlike
typedef).  This makes life a bit easier than C when defining types
because we do not have to put in so many "forward" declarations.  For
instance, in Cyclone, you can write:

  typedef struct IntListNode *intlist;
  struct IntListNode {int hd; intlist tl;};

but in C, you technically have to write something like:

  struct IntListNode;
  typedef struct IntListNode *intlist;
  struct IntListNode {int hd; intlist tl;};

Now presumably because the above is so painful to do in C, they
have an abbreviation of the form:

  typedef struct IntListNode {int hd; struct IntListNode *tl;} *intlist;

which is used quite frequently.  Notice, however, that "intlist" still
cannot be used within the definition of IntListNode.  We will also
support this kind of "double" definition with the understanding that
the above is short hand for the two declarations:

  typedef struct IntListNode *intlist;
  struct IntListNode {int hd; struct IntListNode *tl;};

This expansion supports the far more succinct:

  typedef struct IntListNode {int hd; intlist tl;} *intlist;

because it expands legally into:

  typedef struct IntListNode *intlist;
  struct IntListNode {int hd; intlist *tl;};

Notice that one could even leave the IntListNode tag off the struct
and let C gensym a name for it -- I don't want to support this because
it is then not clear what name should be assigned in an interface if
the type is to be exported (which it usually is.)  It would be nice
if we could write something like:

  typedef struct {int hd; intlist tl;} *intlist;

with the understanding that the struct will be named something
based on the declarator identifier (e.g., intlist_struct).  Of
course, the problem with this is that we can have more than one
declarator identifier:

  typedef struct {int hd; intlist tl;} *intlist, !Intlist;

An alternative would be to support anonymous structs and treat
them using structural equivalence.  However, because the typedef
is just an abbreviation, the above would not be legal (i.e.,
there's no name to tie the knot.)  This is not the case for
newtype (see below).  

It turns out that, in fact, one can write the struct IntListNode {
... } definition within any type expression and this has the side
effect of declaring the type and returning "struct IntListNode".
Still, we want to support this it's just that there are some strange
interactions with qualifiers and type variables.  More about this in a
minute.

Ignoring the above for a second, one can parameterize a type
abbreviation.  So, for instance, we could write:

  typedef struct ListNode<?a> *list<?a>,!List<?a>;
  extern struct ListNode<?a> {?a hd; list<?a> tl;}; // defined elsewhere

  ?a hd<?a>(List<?a> lis) {
    return lis->hd;   // no run-time check
  }

  list<?a> revappend<?a>(list<?a> lis1,list<?a> lis2) {
    while (lis1 != null) {
      lis2 = ^list {lis1->hd, lis2};
      lis1 = lis1->tl;
    }
    return lis2;
  }

Notice that in the "^list {lis1->hd, lis2}" expression, we can
use the type abbreviation instead of "^ struct ListNode".  Also
notice that the type parameters are inferred.  

Because typedef's are abbreviations, they do not support the extern,
static, or abstract qualifiers.  (But see newtype below for this.)  
However, when used in conjunction with a type declaration, then
the qualifiers apply to the declaration.  For instance, one may
write:

  extern typedef struct ListNode<?a> {?a hd; list<?a> tl;} *list<?a>;

because this expands to:

  typedef struct ListNode<?a> *list<?a>;
  extern struct ListNode<?a> {?a hd; list<?a> tl;};

Similar rules apply with data-types.  So, to write out something like
the expression example, we might write:

  typedef char string[?];      // strings are arrays of characters
  typedef id string;           // identifiers are strings
  typedef data ExpNode {id Var; $(exp,exp) App; $(id,exp) Lam} exp;

The typedef declaration trick doesn't work well with mutually-recursive
structures.  Consider a more elaborate form of expressions and declarations:

  typedef data ExpNode { ...; decl Decl; ...} exp;
  typedef struct DeclNode {id decl_var; typ decl_typ; exp decl_exp} *decl;

The above doesn't work because the definition of ExpNode mentions decl
which has not yet been defined.  Rather, we must write something like:

  typedef data ExpNode { ...; struct DeclNode *Decl; ...} exp;
  typedef struct DeclNode {id decl_var; typ decl_typ; exp decl_exp} *decl;

Finally, because typedefs are just abbreviations, the types over which
they are parameterized need not be boxed types -- their kind is
manifest from the way the variables are used within the definition.
So, for instance, we may write:

  typedef ?a !pointer<?a>, *option<?a>;

  struct Foo {char x; int y;}
  pointer<Foo> a;
  option<Foo> b;

Newtypes:
---------
Though a newtype declaration looks like a typedef declaration, they
are more like struct declarations in that equivalence is done by name,
they can be declared extern, abstract, etc.  Unlike struct
declarations, newtypes are always treated as boxed types and thus
their definitions must always be boxed types.  Like structs, data-types,
etc., the type variables for newtypes range over boxed types.
In addition, newtypes provide for hidden (i.e., existentionally-quantified)
type variables.  In this respect, newtype is much like the abstype
mechanism provided by Popcorn.  

For example the following definition declares a newtype closure<?dom,?cod>
that hides a type ?env.  

  abstract newtype $(?cod _(?dom,?env), ?env) !closure<?dom,?cod>;

Notice that ?env is not mentioned as one of the parameters -- any
free type variable within a newtype is treated as an existentially-
quantified variable.  You can coerce a value from the underlying
type to the newtype.  (There's no need to create one using new.)
So, for example, we would write:

  closure<int,bool> f = (closure<int,bool>)(new (f_code,f_env));

It is not legal to coerce back.  Rather, one must use the "with"
statement.  For example, we would apply a closure as follows:

  ?b apply<?a,?b>(closure<?a,?b> f, ?a x) {
    with g[?c] = f {
      return (f[0](x,f[1]));
    }
  }

Switch statements:
------------------
case and default statements must occur within a switch -- they
cannot just occur at random places.  Furthermore, case statements
support full (linear) pattern matching as in ML.  Also, case statements
must be "terminated" by either a break, fallthru, return, or raise.
The semantics is the same as in C -- break transfers control to the
end of the switch statement.  Fallthru falls through to the next
case's statement but isn't always allowed.  In particular, if we
have:

  case <pat_1> : <stmt_1>; fallthru;
  case <pat_2> : <stmt_2>; break;

then the variables bound in <pat_2> must be a subset of the
variables bound in <pat_1>.  Furthermore, these variables must
have the same type.  Finally, <stmt_2> may only use those
variables bound in <pat_2>.  

This is almost the same as writing:

  case <pat_1> : <stmt_1>; <stmt_2>; break
  case <pat_2> : <stmt_2>; break;

except that the variables that are the same in <pat_1> and
<pat_2> must have the same type.  This ensures that the compiler
can easily share the code for <stmt_2> for both cases.

Cases can be qualified by a "with <exp>" form, similar to the
"where" construct in Ocaml.  For example:

  switch e {
    case Var x with strcmp(x,"foo") == 1: ...
    ...
  }

(I used "with" because it's already a keyword.)

Note that default: cases are the same as writing a wild-card pattern.
The patterns in a switch must be exhaustive and non-overlapping.
(With clauses are assumed to return both true and false and are not
compared against one another to see if something is logically
exhaustive (e.g., <exp> and !<exp>).  So if you use a with, then you'd
better cover that case again without a with.)  Someday, we may
put more intelligence into this by recognizing certain
compliment forms.  

Other statement issues:
-----------------------
We provide the "try <stmt> catch { <switch_clauses> }" form
for exception handlers.  Eventually, we'll support finally-clauses.
The switch clauses need not be exhaustive in which case a
default that re-raises the exception will be inserted.

Break and continue statements can mention a label as in Popcorn.
We should support goto as long as it jumps to the same or an outer
enclosing lexical level.  

I've not modified the grammar to support (a) declarations with
for-statements nor (b) declarations within functions that are
not at the beginning of a compound statement.  These were nice
features in Popcorn and someone should figure out how to do them.

As in Popcorn, for, while, and do statements require boolean expressions
in the test position.  C of course has no such requirement.  We might
want to generalize slightly and allow values of type "t*" with the
intention that "null->false" and "not null->true".  

Other grammar additions or changes:
-----------------------------------
"_" is not an identifier.  Tokens of the form ?[a-zA-Z0-9_]+ are
type variables.  true and false become keywords (expressions).  
Expressions of the form .[0-9]+ are not treated as floats/doubles.
A leading zero is required -- this is necessary for tuple projections
to parse.  

"sizeof(e)" returns the number of elements in an array e of type t[c]
or t[?].  I picked sizeof to re-use a keyword.

Polymorphic function variables are implicitly instantiated
at each occurrence (not just function calls).  So, for
instance, if we have:

  extern ?a map<?a,?b>(?b f(?a), list<?a> x);
  extern ?b snd<?a,?b>($(?a,?b) *pair);
  extern list<$(int,bool)*> x;

we can write simply:

  map(snd,x) 

instead of as in popcorn having to write map(snd@<int,bool>,x).
To keep a variable from being instantiated, we prefix with an '@'.

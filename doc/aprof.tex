\subsection{The allocation profiler, \texttt{aprof}}

To get a profile of the allocation behavior of a Cyclone program,
follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compile the program with the flag \texttt{-pa}.  The resulting
  executable will be compiled to record allocation behavior.  It will
  also be linked with a version of the standard library that records
  its allocation behavior.  (If you get the message, ``can't find
  internal compiler file \texttt{libcyc_a.a},'' then ask your system
  administrator to install the special version of the library.)
\item Execute the program as normal.  As it executes, it will write to
  a file \texttt{amon.out} in the current working directory; if the
  file exists before execution, it will be overwritten.
\item Run the program \texttt{aprof}.  This will examine
  \texttt{amon.out} and print a report on the allocation behavior of
  the program.
\end{enumerate}

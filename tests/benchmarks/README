The comp.lang.compilers repository of "public benchmarks" is at
ftp://ftp.nosc.mil/pub/aburto/.  The *-orig.c files in this
directory are not the original files, rather they are what was
left after ripping out the timing code, cleaning up the C a bit,
etc., as necessary to make it possible to port directly to
Cyclone.  The *.cyc files are direct ports -- the output should
be the same as the corresponding C file, and `diff` should give
relatively few changes.



Looking through the original files, licensing issues are mostly
not discussed.  If there's anything at all, it's either just a
"by" or sometimes an explicit "copyright".  There are a few
exceptions none of which I've yet ported to Cyclone (Heapsort and
Sieve of Eratosthenes are noted as being based on published --
book or magazine -- code, and FFT mentions patents, the GPL,
Stanford, and an unnamed company, but then the guy concludes "If
it were up to me, I'd say go do whatever you want with it; but it
would be polite to give credit to [...]") anyway.  And the
maintainer _does_ refer to them as "public".

And I (Jeff Vinocur) hereby make the ported versions as free as
I'm allowed to under the original licenses.

JGM: I note that the output of tfftdp does not match with gcc
(though it's close for some of the cases.)  I've verified that
it's not our printf code so I suspect that it's someting else
(e.g., a coercion gone bad or else a difference with math.h.)

This directory contains a collection of the source code and the results
of a number of public benchmarks (in 'c').  It is maintained by Al Aburto
of the Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Center (NCCOSC)
RDT&E Division (NRaD) in San Diego, CA.  If you have contributions
(program results or programs) or any comments please send them to 
aburto@nosc.mil.

All 'c' programs and tables of results ('.tbl') are available via
anonymous ftp to 'ftp.nosc.mil' in directory 'pub/aburto'. The IP
address for ftp.nosc.mil is: 128.49.192.51

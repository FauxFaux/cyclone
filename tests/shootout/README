This is a Cyclone implementation of the benchmarks from the Great
Programming Language Shootout,

   http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/

The benchmarks have simply been translated from the C versions and are
not optimized in any way.

The C versions are included; do

  make bench

to compile and run the benchmarks in both languages for comparison.

If you want to see how optimized versions run try, e.g.,

  make clean
  make bench CFLAGS=-O2 CYCFLAGS=-O2

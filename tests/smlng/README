Our entry consists of shell-script that drives a couple of executable
files, smlng and validate.  The former file performs the optimizations
while the latter file makes sure that the output is legal input.
The shellscript makes sure we don't exhaust our time limit and that
our output file is both correct and at least as small as the input.

The shellscript assumes some packages are available, including bash,
awk, du, and cat.  It looks as if the RPMS for these packages are
installed at INRIA, but we must assume that the PATH is set up properly
to make them available.  We did not have any RedHat 7.1 machines to test
on, so we are hoping RedHat 6.2 executables will still work.

It was fun to work on!

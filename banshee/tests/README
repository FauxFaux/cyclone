This directory contains a small set of test applications for banshee.
The applications include:

lambda.exe :              A small lambda calculus type inference problem.
dyckcfl-test.exe :        A small Dyck-CFL reachability problem.
dyckcfl-random-test.exe : Checks correctness of the CFL reachability
                          code on random graphs.

In addition, the directory test.programs/ contains a number of large
benchmark programs for the points-to analysis. The directory test.cor/
contains the correct output for these programs. pta_test.mk is a
Makefile that tests your build against the correct output.

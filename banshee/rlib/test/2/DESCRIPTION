This test is just test 1, but allocates a very long list of pairs.  

There is also a timer program for checking performance.  The timer program simply
deserializes and then serializes a large heap.  There are options for performing
only the deserialization or both steps, from which the time of either can be
computed.  Run the driver program with any argument and it will print the 
address of the data in the serialized heap; this number needs to be incorporated
into timer.c.

Makefile:

points to/ RCA/ and exception analaysis:

RCA: points to more refined

exception: RCA points-to

TODO ****

1. Field sensitivity
   modify ast walk to get the correct field

   normalization:
   
   f.g.h = z.x.y

   write(h,read(g,f)) = read(y,read(x,z))

2. Think about ref level assignment

3. Class representation

   Rip out the functionality in :
   bool RCAVisitor::visitTypeSpecifier(TypeSpecifier *spec)
 
   and move it into declarator (each syntactic instance of a class)

4. Modeling of exceptions is too imprecise. We want to model scope
   properly.


5/27/03 Bug in specification semantic analyzer : a type can be used in
a constructor signature, but not defined in the specification. An example:

 specification rca_types : RCA_TYPES = 
   spec
    data rca : set = ref of +foo
   end	

Banshee never checks that foo is defined
